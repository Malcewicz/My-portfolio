## My portfolio

This portfolio showcases my first implementation of Next.js with TypeScript and Firebase for deployment.   
Combining Next.js with Firebase means the website offers reliable performance, fast loading times and efforless deployment.  
The website's fully responsive, so it should look good on any device.
