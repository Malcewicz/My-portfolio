    "description": "While learning Vite, I built a sushi website that showcases responsiveness, fast loading times, animations, and an appealing design. Although it's important to be transparent - the design isn't mine, but by Pickolab studio. Nonetheless, I gained valuable knowledge, and I believe that the quality of the code is what truly matters. Therefore, I consider it a valuable addition to my portfolio until I have more of my own projects.",
