    "description": "Introducing my secret project: a mobile app that I personally designed using Figma and brought to life using the incredible Flutter framework from Google. From the ground up, I poured my heart and soul into creating this sleek design, in both light and dark mode, and user-friendly experience. \n While it's still a work in progress, I'm excited to share the UI/UX design and perhaps even the code once it's ready.",
