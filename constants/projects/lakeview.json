    "description": "In my first freelance project, I designed and coded a responsive, single-page, static website. Using Figma, closely following my client's specifications, I created the design they desired. Then, with a Mobile First approach, I coded the website using semantic HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. \n Since its launch, the website has already attracted over two thousand users.",
